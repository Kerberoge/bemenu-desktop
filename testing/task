TASK:
Given an array of file paths, where the path minus the filename can either be
/home/$USER/.local/share/applications/ or /usr/share/applications/, remove all occurrences
starting with /usr/share/applications/ if there is an occurrence with the same filename
that starts with /home/$USER/.local/share/applications/.

Example:
If both /usr/share/applications/imv.desktop and
/home/$USER/.local/share/applications/imv.desktop exist, remove
/usr/share/applications/imv.desktop from the array of strings (file paths).
